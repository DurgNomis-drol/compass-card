## Wish/Todo list

- Additional entities to show on circle
- Custom styled indicator (per entity)
- Background image
- Hide indicator in certain directions (to use the card to display the sun or moon's movement)
- Css options to change look & feel
- Localisation of direction abbreviation
- Cleanup unused boilerplate code
